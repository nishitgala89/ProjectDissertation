# **ProjectDissertation - MorningStar Mutual Funds Rating prediction**

## **Introduction**
This project is a part of dissertation work as a student at Kingston University, London.
This is a supervised machine learning project wherein we are trying to predict the Mutual Funds rating given by Morningstar based on the features captured. The objective is to check if we can replicate Morningstar's rating process through ML techniques.
The ML algorithms used in the process are as listed below
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest
3. Bagging Classifier with base estimator as Logistic Regression
4. SVM
5. XG Boost
6. Cat Boost
7. Artificial Neural Network
8. Voting Classifier

## **Steps involved in the Project**
1. Data Collection - Data is collected for equity Mutual Funds across UK, Europe developed and Asia develeoped geographies from Morningstar UK website. We have used Selenium for Web Scrapping the data from Morningstar.
2. Data Preparation - The Data is then prepared to remove the duplicate funds and cleansed using missing value, replacement, dropping un-necessary features, creating new features using feature engineering
3. Modelling
